GitHub was blocking your push because API keys were detected in:
1. Current commit files (documentation examples)
2. Old commits in git history

## What I Fixed

- ✅ `FIX_GIT_HISTORY.md` - Replaced real keys with placeholders
- ✅ `rewrite-history.bat` - Replaced real keys with placeholders  
- ✅ `rewrite-history.sh` - Replaced real keys with placeholders
- ✅ `secrets-to-remove.txt` - Replaced real keys with placeholders

### 2. Created Solution Guides

- ✅ `PUSH_NOW.md` - Simple push instructions
- ✅ `FINAL_PUSH_GUIDE.md` - Complete 6-step guide

## ✅ Recommended Solution: Allow Secret on GitHub

This is the **easiest and safest** approach:

### Why This Works
- ✅ No force push needed (safe)
- ✅ No risk of breaking things
- ✅ Takes 2 minutes
- ✅ You rotate the key immediately after
- ✅ Old key becomes useless
- ✅ New key never goes in git

```

**Step 2:** Click "Allow secret" button

**Step 3:** Push again
```bash
git push origin main
```

**Step 4:** Immediately rotate your API key
- Go to https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys
- Delete old key
- Generate new key
- Update Railway with new key

## Alternative: Rewrite Git History (Advanced)

If you want to completely remove secrets from history:

### Files Created
- `REWRITE_HISTORY_GUIDE.md` - Full documentation
- `rewrite-history.bat` - Windows script
- `rewrite-history.sh` - Linux/Mac script

### Warning
- ⚠️ Requires force push
- ⚠️ Breaks other developers' repos
- ⚠️ More complex
- ⚠️ Higher risk

**Recommendation: Use the "Allow Secret" method instead!**
